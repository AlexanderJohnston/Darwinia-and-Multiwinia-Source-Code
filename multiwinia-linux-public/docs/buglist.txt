- Team currently stores a m_currentUnitId, m_currentEntityId, and m_currentBuildingId.
  These are updated by network requests.  However you now need an entityId AND
  an entityUniqueId to correctly identify a single entity.  This will eventually

  in string form.  These strings need to be moved into the language file as they
  are used in game.  However they are also used as identifiers in our game.txt file.
