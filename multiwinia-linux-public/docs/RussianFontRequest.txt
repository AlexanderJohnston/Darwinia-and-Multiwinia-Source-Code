in data\textures\unicode there are three fonts:
	speccy
	square
	editor
	
The Latin-1 characters can be found in the files with extension
	.0020.00ff.bmp
	
The Cyrillic characters can be found in the files with extension 
	.0410.042f.bmp
	.0430.044f.bmp
	
The only font with Cyrillic characters is Speccy, so what I've
done is copy Speccy -> Square and Editor. However, ideally, 
we would like to have Cyrillic glyphfs for "square" and "editor" fonts

I've included the latin-1 characters so that you can see what
style the fonts should be.

Would it be possible to make up some custom Square and Editor 
cyrillic bitmaps?

If you modify the textures, you can try it out in game by copying 
the data directory here to C:\Program Files\Multiwinia
(so that you get C:\Program Files\Multiwinia\data\...)

All the best
