===================

-Control scheme change
    The biggest changes are:
    - New marker icons above units for easy selection, and new rendering effects to show currently selected unit
    - Old mouse cursor system replaced with new one, including an icon to represent currently selected unit
    - Right clicking on unit markers will toggle unit state
    - Control change : we are now using right click to move, rather than left. In fact the left button only selects now. We've done this because a number of people have had difficulty getting used to left click to move, when all other rts games (including defcon) use right click to move as standard. Many players often issue accidental move commands when trying to select a new unit.
