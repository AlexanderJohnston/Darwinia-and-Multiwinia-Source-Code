VERSION 1.9.29 Group D
===================

Welcome to the Multwinia Beta Programme!

Welcome to the Multiwinia beta test! We really appreciate your help in testing our game, it's been in development for a while now. Testing have been going well for the last couple months and now we're looking forward to put the final touch!

You've been selected as part of test group D. You'll be starting off with 4 of the game modes called King of the Hill, Assault, Rocket Riot and Capture the Statue.

This Multiwinia beta version will record benchmarks of how well your computer runs the game, and will automatically upload these benchmarks to our ftp server when you exit. These benchmark files also contain information about your computer hardware, taken from dxdiag. You can view the exact files that are being uploaded - they will be stored in a "benchmarks" folder inside your Multiwinia Profile folder. Similarly, if the game crashes it will compile a crash report and will submit this to our site. If you are unwilling to participate in the beta knowing we are gathering stats from your computer, please let us know and do not run the game.

On a last note, you may wish to try the Tutorials first to introduce you to the game and connect to IRC ( http://forums.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/viewtopic.php?t=16 ) to find people to play with,

Testing the autopatcher
=====

Currently, the autopatcher is not run by default. To run it, you must navigate to your game directory and launch "autopatch.exe". In most cases, a window should pop up, a search for updates will be performed and then the game will be launched.

Basic operation
* Try running "autopatch.exe" to ensure that the game launches correctly and in a reasonable time
* Try it whilst not connected to the internet

Vista Users
* Install the game in a user owned directory and launch "autopatch.exe"
* Install under "Program Files" and try "autopatch.exe"
* Run "autopatch.exe" as a limited user

Integrity Checks
 Integrity checks are performed using "autopatch --repair"
 The autopatcher should be able to repair corrupt game files. It will not do this if launched normally. Be aware that this will require downloading new versions of damaged files, so if you have a slow internet connection, it's best not to corrupt the larger game files.
* Run integrity check with pristine game files
* Delete and/or corrupt a/some game file(s) and start integrity check
* Close/kill the autopatcher during a download and restart the check

Updates
* When we have an update available, we'll let you know

We would like to know if the autopatcher crashes, fails to load the game, tries to redownload pristine game files, does not detect corrupt or missing game files when an internet connection is available, freezes in the absence of an internet connection or generally misbehaves. While performing an integrity check or upgrade, there may be a period of unresponsiveness whilst files are checked, but this shouldn't last more than a matter of seconds.
