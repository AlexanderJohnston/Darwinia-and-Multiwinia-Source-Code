CODING
======
            
- Save system                                                               
    Dynamic building data to be saved:
        pattern buffer                      game file
        Officer absorb shields

- Sound System                                                              
    Stream music / ambient oggs rather than caching
    Stereo support for music
    Rename CachedSampleHandle to SampleHandle
        permit reading of oggs without cache use
            
- (OPTIONAL) Pause while options menus are up

- (OPTIONAL) Intro bootloaders                                                
    - Subversion mind control signals
    - Uplink start seq

THINGS
======
                                                         
SQUADDIE            - Decent death animation (replace shape explosion)
      
OFFICER             - Flag is bugged at low frame rates

RESEARCH            - Decent capture animation


=========
CUTSCENES
=========

- Intro cutscene should always play when a new profile is created


==================
CONTROLS THAT SUCK
==================

- "Too many programs running" shouldn't play the gesture success sound

- Radar Dish control : no guides for what to aim for

- Cannon: aren't sensible enough when firing...they often slaughter friendly units or try to fire through hills
- Cannon: are hard to fire upwards, camera bounces around a lot
- Cannon: Selection causes the camera to raise up a lot

- Officer: Cancelling orders doesn't do anything immediately - some people remain looking until they are sure
    no more orders come out of the officer

BUGS
====

- Fix ding sound when ALT-ASWD is pressed
- Fix alt-tab not working for some people
    THIS IS CAUSED BY WINXP POWER TOOLS, which rebinds ALT-TAB in some way
- Anthill sometimes saves ant population as a silly number, which causes a crash on reloading
- Crashes reported on biosphere...memory leak?
- Spam mail graphical effect is invisible when Christmas mode is running
- Radar Dish : When reloaded from save game, takes several seconds to re-align


- If you have an officer on FOLLOW and he goes into a tp, it takes sometime for the DGs 
    following him to realise.  Sometimes they go into the water

TODO LIST
=========

- Loading a savegame that used a mod causes a crash
- Invert Mouse Option?

- Add acosfSafe and asinfSafe (JOHNNY)

- (POST GOLD) Bonus Material for the website   
        1 - before launch
        2 - at launch
        3 - after launch
                    
        STORY
            1.Adverts from the manual eg the Protologic 68000 ad

        PROMOS
            1.Post Card
            1.Flyers

        FUTUREWAR
            3.Old versions of Darwinia                                    (eg the 4 way battle demo, or an early alpha of the mine)

        DEVELOPMENT
            3.Concept document                                            (there are two, I could scan them, about 20 pages)
        
- UI improvements
    Selecting a unit already causes yellow arrows to appear.  These should start larger and animate
        down to the current size, before fading out.  A selection sound should play.
    Deselecting a unit should run the animation in reverse, with a deselection sound.    
    Clicking somewhere that fails (eg creating a unit, or navigating an impossible route) should play a
        failure sound.
    Add instant animation when officer orders are cleared
    Allow rebinding of alt-tab, ctrl-c

- Translation System working
    Use English strings as fallback if they aren't in translated file
    Issues:
        - "none" is used a possible mod name in the codebase
        - "none" and "random" are used as possible bootloader names
        - control_bindings.cpp at the bottom. Event names like "Left", "Zoom" are statically defined
            These strings are used in building the prefs names.
