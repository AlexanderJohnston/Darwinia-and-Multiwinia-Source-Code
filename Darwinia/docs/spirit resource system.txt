
- When enemy troops die they leave behind a spirit
    The spirit gradually floats away over the course of a minute
    You can collect these spirits and use them to spawn new creatures
    When your creatures die they die for good and can not be respawned


- New unit type : Garbage Collector 
    These guys can be created at processors like any troop type
    Their role is to collect dead spirits and transport them back to your processors
    They are defensive - they will automatically grab "safe" enemy spirits
    They can be told to grab "dangerous" enemy spirits ie where you don't control the area
    They hover above the ground and can collect spirits 2 or 3 at a time
    They are weak, and if they die they will drop their spirits
    They take longer to collect spirits that have almost floated away
    

- Factories now need spirits to produce new units
    The spirits are visible in a factory, floating around in a capture area
    You can volutarily recyle your own troops by marching them in to a factory
        Your troops march in and die in a humorous way
