Assumptions:

- 100,000 objects in the world
- All objects need to know all other objects in neighbouring cells (9 cells total)
- All update about 10 times per second
- All objects move from one cell to an adjacent one regularly
- In order to get a small number of neighbours we will have a grid of 632x632
- Using the 80/20 rule we know most cells will be empty. 80% of objects in 20% of cells.
- Average 10 objects in the 20% of occupied cells.

- Landscape is 10,000m square
- Man can run at 3 m/s
- Cell is 15m across
- Man takes 5 seconds to cross a cell
- Therefore 20,000 cell changes per second (total for all objects) (3e4)


Things That Need To Fast:

- Find all objects nearby (100,000 * 10 * 9 = 9e6 per second)
- Remove from cell (3e4)
- Add to cell (3e4)
