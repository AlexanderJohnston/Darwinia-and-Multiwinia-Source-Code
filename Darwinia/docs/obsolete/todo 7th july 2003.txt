FIRST PLAYABLE SHIT LIST
========================

- Engineers need to be expensive
- Easy to build 2 bridges by accident
- Bridges can be any length - no cost
- Not enough sound density
- Big gun doesn't feel / look right
- Camera is very volatile at low frame rates
- No visual distinction between engineer types
- No engineer-action visual effects
- Nothing explaining power station -> force field link
- A new player wouldn't have a clue
- Need better bridge building diagram
