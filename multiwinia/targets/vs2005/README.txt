What's changed?
-Removed all not required additional directories from vsprops (c:\dev\directx sdk, etc), for me it's builds about 50 times faster
-Enabled minimal rebuild

How to use:
Just install latest directx sdk and windows 7 platform sdk and you ready to build multiwinia (Tested with August 2009 DirectX SDK and Windows SDK 7.1)

Plans:
Port to vs2010
