- (DONE) Replace Netclass (ANDY)

    edit prefs to specify server details
    fix determinism
    Ensure floating point accuracy over multiple platforms

    Uses network code from game, in a seperate project
    Allows one of the connected clients to control the options
    Preferences file determines privalidge options eg password

- LAN multicast                                                                                     1 day                   Medium

    GUI for server guy to pick game options
    Transmission system for server to send game options to connected clients

- Master game server (JOHNNY)                                                                       (johhny)
    Game servers inform master server of their existence
    Game clients download server list from master and query each game server
    
- (OPTIONAL) Possible optimisations
    Dont bother sending mouse position unless buttons are pressed

- (OPTIONAL) Global leaderboard
    When a server game completes, the results are uploaded to the Master Server
    Master Server maintains lists of all known players



==================
OUTSTANDING ISSUES
==================

- Currently we have no way for a Client to determine its own IP.  The whole client 
    identity system requires this to work somehow.  Most likely the Server will
    inspect a clients IP, then inform the client in some way.

- Creating a CPU player should automatically spawn an AI entity to control the
    Darwinians.

- We are currently relying on a lot of manually set Prefs values to control things.
    Need to intelligently spawn Multiwinia objects when required.

- Still have problems when spawning things that belong to a team that hasn't connected.
    eg Triffids...should be a generic non-player team.  Perhaps reserve team 0 for
    stuff that will always appear?
