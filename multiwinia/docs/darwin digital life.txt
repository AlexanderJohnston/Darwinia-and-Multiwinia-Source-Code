Andy,

Just got off the phone with Kelvin, he had a number of cool ideas and themes for
Future War that he wanted to discuss.  A lot of these ideas flow on from what
we've alredy discussed.  This top level story gives us a nice selection of
mission ideas, objectives and maps.

- The green guys begin life behaving as cows.  They're dumb, they eat and move
around very slowly.
- The red virus outbreak takes place, they start to get destroyed at an alarming 
rate
- The red virus knows instinctively the whole system can be reset with a master
control switch, probably located in the central island, so they steal all of Dr
Sepulveda's research and program code, and position it in well defended areas.
Effectively holding it hostage.
- Player spends the first half of the game attempting to retrieve all of the
vital data and research, and to secure the vital areas of the world with Greens
remaining army.
- Sepulvedas unfinished program code is gradually completed by the Doctor,
allowing you to upgrade your squad and the green guys with new abilities and
equipment.
- Eventually they're a fairly competent army with tanks, guns etc.
- You fight to get red under control, locked down perhaps on 3 islands that are
totally isolated.
- You notice emergent intelligence in Greens behaviour, particularly on one
island where they are building something of their own accord.
- This device is a large communications tower, designed to set up a link with
the outside world.  Green has evolved to the point of group intelligence and
wishes to escape the confines of Sepulvedas simulation.
- Unfortunately you have personally trained and upgraded them to be quite a
destructive and powerful force, and you have personally helped them to secure
all of the key points on the map.
- You now have to stop green by hindering their efforts to build the
communication tower.
- Ultimately you need to get to the master reset switch in the middle of the
world, and trigger a global wipe of all life.
- They will require several items from around the world to complete the comms
tower, you could intercept these items.
- You can also trigger large scale release of the Red virus, in order to
distract and disrupt greens efforts.
- Once the reset is triggered the whole world will be wiped, this might take a
while, eg a large visible barrier working its way across the world, wiping out
all life.
- Green will move much faster and more desperately once the reset is triggered.
They might get the gate open and start transporting out - the number of escaped
green will contribute to your final score
- Perhaps once the whole world is wiped, you see an end sequence where a few
green spirits merge and a couple of new green guys are born, with the same
cow-like behaviour as at the start.
