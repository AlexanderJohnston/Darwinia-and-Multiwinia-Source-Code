
- The Server currently has a DArray of ServerToClient objects
    These represent a network socket connection
    Their index represents their teamId

- Due to arrival of Virtual Players, a single Client might have more than one team

- Modify Server to include two structures:
    DArray of Teams          <- includes which Client is responsible for this team
    DArray of Clients        <- includes socket connection

- The process of a new Client joining should be split into two seperate events:
    
    A new Client joins.  Establish a new socket connection.
    A Client requests a Team assignment.  This may be a Player or a Virtual Player.
    
- This will permit 
    Clients without a Team (spectators)
    Clients with three Teams (Single Player Game)
    Clients with one Team (Multi Player Game)
    or Clients playing a Multi Player game, with an AI running locally As Well
