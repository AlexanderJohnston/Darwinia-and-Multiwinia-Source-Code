 
Brainstormed ideas for objects / obstacles etc

Desired qualities : 
    -   Generic
    -   Re-usable
    -   Multi-purpose
    -   Interactive
    -   Logical

We want objects that make the game challenging, interesting, fun

Above all, all objects in game should interact with each other
creating emergent properties and strategies
and allowing us to create puzzles by clever use of interaction between objects


======
GOLDEN
======

- Call to arms
    An object that you can place anywhere on the map, that causes all green
    guys and equipment to move towards it

- Altar
    green guys move into it, and are sacrified immediately into a spirit

- Persuadatron
    Nearby green guys automatically begin following your squad around
    Will help fire at enemies

=============
SQUAD WEAPONS
=============

It is my opinion that all weapons should be variations on the 2 basic items
that each squad member has - a sword and a shield


- Basic gun         fires up to max range, rapid fire
- Basic shield      comes up for a couple of seconds, deflects incoming
                    knocks squad member back slightly
                    Only has (say) 180 degree coverage

- Sword             close combat, very high damage
- Grenade           thrown in arc, can go over things, out of line of sight
- Rocket            flies in a straight line, fast, long range

(Both grenade and rocket are actually a thrown sword, leaving the thrower
 without a weapon until it returns)


SPECIAL ATTACKS

These would probably be triggered by a gesture of some kind

- SHOTGUN           just like basic gun, except all guns go off at once
                    then they all reload. bonus damage for all hits
                    Squad pauses just before firing, to brace for it

- SPIN              Squad forms a circle, swords facing outwards
                    They spin very fast, centered around your mouse pos

- AIR STRIKE        All swords lock on to the mouse location and point to it
                    Bombers fly in and drop payload on that area

- AIR LIFT          Those same bombers fly in, pick you up, follow the mouse,
                    then drop you on your command

- ROMAN SHIELD      All shields go up for a longer period of time
                    squad marches forwards, through ranks of enemies

- JETPACK JUMP      Squad does a long floaty jump 
                    (shield on back acts as jetpack)

- HOVER BOARDS      Shields become hover boards, squad can fly-move, hovering
                    slightly above the ground, lots of momentum


=====
GREEN
=====

- Landing craft
    Approaches an island then spawns loads of green guys
   
- Drop ship
    Approaches, lands, drops loads of guys, flies away

- Green Factory
    Green guys / engineers lift spirits in to it
    It spits out more green guys

=== 
RED
===

- Catapult
    Nearby red creatures are sucked in while it is retracted
    Then it fires, launches them into an area far away
    Then it retracts, repeat

- Gooey blob
    Starts out as a small red blob, gets larger and larger, 
    covering parts of the map

- Surrounder
    Like a worm, but tries to form a complete circle around you
    then everything within that circle gets a big shock

- Softback
    Some kind of bug that has hard armour at the front
    Faces you, occasionally charges right at you
    You have to jump out of the way, then shoot it in the back

- Squasher
    Fairly long legs, stands high off the ground
    Quite large surface area underneath
    Gets above you, then sits down rapidly, squashing you
    When it sits down its vulnerable to grenades  or something

- Splitter
    Starts big
    You shoot it, it splits into 2 smaller bits that move faster

=====
WORLD
=====

- Laser Fence
    Blocks off areas of the map
    Can only be shut down by disconnecting / destroying power source

- Wall
    Impassable by ground
    Can be blown up with enough force

- Spirit Receiver
    Sits in the middle of the map, receives clumps of spirits every 
    few seconds, distributes them to the nearby area
    Can be connected in a grid, so spirits come to the central receiver,
    then travel to one of the connected receivers randomly

- Activation pad
    Requires a certain number of guys stood on it before it triggers
    Can be connected to anything that is toggle-able
    
- Tree / forest
    Acts as an obstacle to anything in the air, but can be walked through
    Can catch fire, sets fire to adjacent objects
    Provides cover from air-strikes
    ? Spawn seeds which sprout into new trees, so gradually spreads ?

- Chasm
    A hole in the ground where polygons have fallen away, leaving blackness
    Death to anyone who falls in
    Can be used to block off areas
    ? Can be created by excessive action in one area ?

- Cannons
    Fires on enemy units
    Can be blown up, or captured and turned to your side

- Bridge
    Buildable by engineers, bypasses many obstacles

- Water Level
    Could rise, cutting off / isolating areas, drowning trapped creatures
    Could be made to lower, opening up previously unaccessable areas

- Quicksand
    People sink at a rate every second, eventually die
    Spirit pops out a few seconds later

- Moving machinery obstacles
    eg crushers, squashers etc, that move in a easily detectable pattern


======
GLOBAL
======

- Transmitter dishes
    Open up links to other islands

- Processor towers
    Give you more processor cyles, ie can run more programs

- Backup stations
    Takes a "backup" of a level in preparation to attempting it
    Can restore backup if you fail
    Each restoration causes degradation in the level


=====
TRAPS
=====

- Boulder
    Rolls fairly slowly, always downhil, until it reaches water
    Could be spawned every few seconds at top of mountain
    Could be trapped behind release mechanism, eg a wall
    Will destroy pretty much anything on contact

- Gas
    Lots of gas clouds are spawned, float around for a bit

- Cannon / turret
- Explosives
- Land mines
- Chasms            (open up once trap is sprung)

- Disarmable by engineer if you know exactly where they are


========
TRIGGERS
========

- Laser trigger         - ie a red line that you walk through
- Pad trigger           - step on it to trigger
                          possibly have to remain stood on it or it untriggers
- Sound trigger         - any noise sets it off
- Motion sensor         - anything that moves fast sets it off
- Line of sight camera  - pans around, 45 degree fov
- Connected swites      - eg towers, you have to turn all them on to trigger
- Shoot me trigger      - you have to hit it with a laser to trigger it
