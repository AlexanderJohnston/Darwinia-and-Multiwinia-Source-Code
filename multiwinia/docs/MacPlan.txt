MAC OS X FIRST PLAYABLE                                          
=======================                                          

The plan is to first port Darwinia to GCC/SDL for Mac OS X. Targetting Mac OS 
Classic is being initially ruled out because:

1. OS X comes with a free IDE/Compiler that is supported by SDL. The compiler
   is GCC, with which we have lots of experience. OS Classic would probably
   require the purchase of Codewarrior.
2. OS Classic would require the purchase and installation of OS Classic -
   either by repartitioning the harddisk in the Mac we buy, or by buying
   an extra harddisk.
3. Typical consumer CPU and GFX hardware is lower spec on the Mac than
   the PC. Darwinia is going to struggle to run on any Mac more than a year
   or two old. I'm guessing that most Macs capable of running Darwinia will
   have OS X anyway.

The minimum spec is probably around an 700mhz G4 with a Geforce 2 MX standard
of graphics hardware. 

Below is an ordered list of the work that needs doing. The last item,
the control system, can be done at any time.
