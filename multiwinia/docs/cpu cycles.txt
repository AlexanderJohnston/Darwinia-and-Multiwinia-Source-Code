CPU CYLES
=========

Abstract : The player can run programs which use up processor cyles
           More processor cycles are available by capturing Processor buildings
           Holding SHIFT allows gestures to be drawn which run programs.
           Pressing ALT-TAB switches between running programs.
           Pressing CTRL-BREAK terminates a running program.
           Number keys allow fast swapping between programs.
           
           There will be several Debug Zepellins floating around the map
           Which show information to the player


============
TASK MANAGER
============

At any one time the player could be running several programs - Squad 1, 
Squad 2, Engineer, Laser Fence etc.
Holding down ALT key will bring up a small box of currently running programs 
in the middle of the screen, and allow the player to TAB through all 
running programs.  Each highlighted program brings up a little bit of data 
about it - memory usage, version number etc.
Releasing ALT task-switches to that program.  The camera moves.  
This is supposed to be identical to the Windows task manager ALT-TAB behaviour.
Should probably implement ALT-SHIFT-TAB for switching to previous task, just to
be consistent.
The task manager should contain additional info on CPU usage - eg
some indication of how many cycles each task is using up, how much is free etc.
Just like ALT-TAB in Windows, but it each task icon scaled based on usage.
ALT-TAB is extremely fast and has become second nature for all Windows users, 
hopefully this system will capture that.



===========
TERMINATION
===========

A program can be terminated at any time by pressing CTRL-BREAK.  The running
program is immediately shut down and dissapears from the world.  The processor
usage is NOT recovered immediately - the task slowly fades out of memory, 
gradually freeing up the memory over several seconds.  Eg shutting down a Squad
task should free up (say) 8 processor cycles, which become available again at a
rate of 1 every 2 seconds.

A task such as Air Strike can be dependant on available Cycles.  Eg an Air 
strike delivered with 2 CPU cycles is half as effective as an Air Strike of
4 CPU cyles.  Either the Air Strike uses all available CPU cyles for max effect
or (possibly) the gesture determines CPU Cyles used.  I suspect in reality 
people will ALWAYS want to do an air strike as powerful as possible though.



========
GESTURES
========

At any time the player can press SHIFT, hold the lmb, and draw a gesture.  Each
available program will have an associated gesture which triggers the program.

SHIFT-Gesture could become very fast and second nature if trained properly.
Drawing the gesture leaves trails on screen, and the gesture hardens up and
plays a sound effect.  The players icon then changes so he can place the item -
eq squad, air strike etc on the map.  At this point the program is already
running/using up cycles, just in STASIS mode.  If the player Task-Switches to 
another program then returns, the icon returns and he can place the task.



===========
NUMBER KEYS
===========

Pressing a number key fast swaps to that task, eg 1 = Squad1, 2 = Engineer.
You have to know the task number, which means ALT-TAB will probably be more
widely used, since most people won't.



=========
ZEPELLINS
=========

Sepulveda has designed several Zepellin's to help him build the world.  They 
are themselves physical world objects that run as programs, that he can access.
They are shaped like giant zepellins and orbit around a fixed point, but they
generally have a large LCD-screen type device on one side that displays
information to the world.

The Zepellins show up as running tasks and actually take up CPU cycles.  The
player will be able to Task Switch to these Zepellins, and the camera will move
until it is looking right at the display screen, with the level in the 
background.

The player will have a Gestures Zepellin.  The screen will show the available
programs, and the gestures required to run those programs.  
The player can click on the programs to run them directly, but this will 
clearly not be as fast as a SHIFT-Gesture.  

This will be very handy at the start, but eventually will not be needed, so the
player can terminate it.  The gesture for running the Gestures Zepellin 
should be very very simple - something memorable, so the player can summon the
Gestures Zepellin should he need it at any time.

The player will also have a Mission Objectives Zepellin.  This shows a list of
objectives, status of those objectives (complete, in progress, failed) 
and contains a map of the world which shows the key areas.

At the very start of the game the player is touring Sepulveda's themepart in a
tourist Zepellin - which just means he's inside it looking down on the world.
