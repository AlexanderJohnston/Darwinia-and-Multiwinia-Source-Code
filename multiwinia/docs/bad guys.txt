
GROUPING BEHAVIOUR

- Remain as a fixed static group, regardless of casualties eg Space Invaders.  
        Their behaviour changes as they are reduced in number.
        ie maybe they become faster / more aggressive as you attack

- Groupings change based on casualties
        ie Asteroids - a group splits up into smaller / faster groups 
        when attacked

- Swarming / flocking
        No overall group objective, but emergent movements

- Timid response
        They march towards you, but back away when you attack


- Herdable


ATTACK TYPES

- Exploding when they get near
        Possibly on a timer
        They are attracted to other creature types and will latch on

- Flaming creatures
        Aim to run into you and set fire to your group

- Spawners
        When they explode they shower the area in newborn seeds




ARRIVAL TYPES

- Spawn from hole in ground
- Factory
- Dropped of by mothership / flying thing on helipad
- Crawl out of water
- Egg fields



LIFE CYCLES
 
- Mother wasp, very large, shits out fields of eggs
- Fields of eggs spawn into little wasps
- Those wasps then will attack if you go near
- Some attack, some grow until becoming mother wasps
