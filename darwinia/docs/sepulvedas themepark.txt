THE WORLD
=========

    - Dr Sepulveda has created a large virtual world
    - The world is made up of lots of islands, each one connected to its 
        neighbours by large links
    - Populated by a form of artificial life - The Green Guys
    - These Green Guys just amble around
    - His plan is to bring tourists in, fly them around in a digital Zepellin,
        then allow them to play various games set in this world

    - Something goes wrong, some Red Virii are created
    - These Red Virii go on the rampage, and start killing Green Guys
    - They then drag the Green spirits back to "Nests", 
        and new Red Virii are spawned
    - As their population grows, they begin to develop Emergent Intelligence

    - The Red Virii quickly take control of various key things and hide them
    - eg
        Sepulvedas research documents
        Programs for Engineers, Debug tools etc
        Communication devices



===========
VIRII TYPES
===========

    - Basic Red Virii
        Small individual entity, shootable
        Moves fast and erratically
        Once in range comes towards target mindlessly
        Attaches to target, kills it after a couple of seconds
        Carries spirit back to Nest

    - Swoopers
        Swoops down on target from air
        Picks up target, drops over Nest

    - Kamikaze bombers
        Walk towards target, explode
        Kill lots

    - "Motherships"
        Slow moving, large, fly overhead
        Drop loads of new Virii or eggs all over the place

    - Carrier
        Slow moving, large fly overhead
        Lots of Virii attach to it and move about the landscape

    - Spawn plant
        Gradually builds up charge, before discharging lots of Virii



==========
GREEN GUYS
==========

    - Initially useless, ambling, slow, unarmed
    - Need to be ushered from one place to another
    - Gradually power up over the course of the game
        New weapons eg lasers
        Speed
        Intelligence

    - Initially they are slaughtered because they have no weaponry
    - You start to see Green counter-attacks a few levels into the game
    - By the end, Green are in full attack mode
     


=============
MISSION TYPES
=============

    - Lemmings style recovery of Green Guys
        escort them to safety while being waylaid by Virii

    - Recovery of stolen Research / Code
        Gets you a new object / weapon etc

    - Eliminate all Red Guys
        Spawners / Motherships require special action to kill

    - Capture comms port to allow access to new location

    - Upgrading of Green Guys
        Mid term objectives such as Research New Weapon
        Might require resources eg 200 spirits, some memory, some code
        Capture and hold a Processor while your program runs

    - Sepulveda has a number of programs almost ready to run
        eg New Laser, Level Wipe, Air Strike
        Each requires resources to run eg 200 spirits, 500 CPU cycles, 50Mb mem
        You can capture these resources "on the side" as you perform missions
        Then you can run programs when you need to
    
    - Escort the Last Reprogrammer Engineer to a de-rez terminal, so Sepulveda 
        can extract his Reprogram code and give it to your squad
