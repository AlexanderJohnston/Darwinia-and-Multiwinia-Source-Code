 FIRST PLAYABLE
 ==============


This document details all the work that must be completed for first playable
of project Future War.  This represents a cut down version of the game
which can still be played and enjoyed.  It will have a few unit types and 
spell types, and virtually no visual effects.  It will be multiplayer only.



- ENTITY STATISTICS
    All entities will be created from a blueprint
    Each entity will have a number of stats
        Health              Higher means I can take more damage
        Strength            Controls how much damage I can cause
        Speed               Controls how fast I move and Fight
        Toughness           Enemy strength must overcome this to cause damage
        Intelligence        Higher means I can think better, but might refuse orders
        Morale              Low means i'm likely to run or refuse orders


- WIZARDS
    Each player will be given one wizard at the start of the game.
    That wizard can be moved around directly.
    Death = game over + all creatures / spells destroyed

- SPELL CAST

    Basic gesture recognition in place.

    of visual marker for the summon point, and the time to summon implemented.
    It will be possible to set the size of the summon gate.
    It will be possible to summon creatures as illusion.  (extra rune : ILLUSION)
