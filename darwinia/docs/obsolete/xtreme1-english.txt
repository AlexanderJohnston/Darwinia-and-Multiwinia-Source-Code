# Cutscene 1: Research Stolen from Labs
# ================================================

cutscene_researchstolen_1	Well done, you've cleared the sandbox island.
cutscene_researchstolen_2 	Next we need to reclaim the Research Labs.
cutscene_researchstolen_3	That's where I kept all my most important files - my research source code.
cutscene_researchstolen_4	The red creatures hijacked the main server there and stolen the files...
cutscene_researchstolen_5	You can see the red creatures everywhere.
cutscene_researchstolen_6	They are holding me to ransom. 
cutscene_researchstolen_7	I can't reboot the system to destroy the red creatures because I'll loose my research too.
cutscene_researchstolen_8	You must help me recover all my research files, so I can put them back where they belong.
cutscene_researchstolen_9	My research files look like glowing scrolls. You can see some above the Labs building.
cutscene_researchstolen_10	The scrolls are very valuable. The source code they contain will help me write new debug tools that you can use in the war against the red virii.

# Cutscene 2: Red Outbreak
# ================================================

cutscene_redoutbreak_1		Darwinia wasn't always filled with those red creatures.
cutscene_redoutbreak_2		It used to be a peaceful place until they arrived...
cutscene_redoutbreak_3		I designed the world as a place for the green creatures to live and evolve.
cutscene_redoutbreak_4		The red creatures were created when the source code for the green creatures was corrupted.
cutscene_redoutbreak_5		They began to spread through the world like a virus, destroying everything in their path.
cutscene_redoutbreak_6		I had to prevent them spreading further...
cutscene_redoutbreak_7		So I shut down all the network ports that allow communication between the islands...

# Sepulveda asks you to build a green army
# ================================================

cutscene_buildarmy_1        Now that we have the containment field open, we need to work on wiping out the red infection.
cutscene_buildarmy_2        We won't be strong enough to do this on our own. We need Green's help.
cutscene_buildarmy_3        The key to this is to get Green to build an army.
cutscene_buildarmy_4        This is the main Construction Yard. It can be used to build what we need. Currently it is offline.
cutscene_buildarmy_5        The Construction Yard uses up two major resources
cutscene_buildarmy_6        Power comes in from the Generator...
cutscene_buildarmy_7        And raw materials come in from the Pixel Mines.
cutscene_buildarmy_8a       This is the Generator. Currently its offline, you'll need to bring it back up.
cutscene_buildarmy_8b       In order to do that you'll need to align the Solar panels around this level
cutscene_buildarmy_8c       So that they all face heaven.
cutscene_buildarmy_9a       And this is the pixel mines.
cutscene_buildarmy_9b       They're overrun with red infection, so you'll need to clear those out.
cutscene_buildarmy_9c       Then you'll need to mine a minimum of 1000 raw polygons from the mines...
cutscene_buildarmy_9d       And refine them into primitives at the Refinery.
cutscene_buildarmy_10       Once you've done that, you should be able to bring the Construction Yard online. And start building a Green army
cutscene_buildarmy_11       Good luck!


# ================================================
# Cutscene 4: YardOnline
# ================================================

cutscene_yardonline_1		The Construction Yard is now online.
cutscene_yardonline_2		The green army is building up, and you are going to need it.
cutscene_yardonline_3		The biospheres are the strong-hold of the red infection...
cutscene_yardonline_4		They are using the incubators to generate more virii on a massive scale.
cutscene_yardonline_5		Use the green army to destroy the red army and recapture the incubators

cutscene_greenvictory_1     We've cleared the red infection!
cutscene_greenvictory_2     Look at them celebrating!

cutscene_greenvictory_7     WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
cutscene_greenvictory_8     My God, what are they doing?
cutscene_greenvictory_9     And I thought we were done
cutscene_greenvictory_10    Get down there and hack the Yard console
cutscene_greenvictory_11    We have to know what they're up to

# Strings from cutscene 6 - 
# Shows greens plans to launch the ARK to heaven
# ================================================

cutscene_arkplans_1         Ok so we've got a hold of Greens plans
cutscene_arkplans_2         Lets have a look at what they have in mind.
cutscene_arkplans_3         My god, what on earth is that thing?
cutscene_arkplans_4         It looks like its flying to heaven
cutscene_arkplans_5         Green must be planning on launching that ship and travelling to heaven
cutscene_arkplans_6         This is terrible, if Green reaches heaven they will be able to escape Darwinia and into the open Internet
cutscene_arkplans_7         We have to stop them!


# ================================================
# Sandbox Babel Test
# ================================================

cutscene_babeltest_1		Ok lets try the Babel virus i've written
cutscene_babeltest_2        Its worked, they've split into different sides
cutscene_babeltest_3        Now we need to deploy this over all of Darwinia
cutscene_babeltest_4        Go to the main upgrade port and drop the Babel virus in
cutscene_babeltest_5        Good luck


# ================================================
# Strings from cutscene 7 -
# Babel spreads throughout the land, final flight of ARK
# ================================================

cutscene_final_1            Looks like the Babel Virus has been accepted
cutscene_final_2            Its spreading to all the green in Darwinia and breaking them up into groups
cutscene_final_3            Looks like Darwinia is going to be a pretty violent place for a while
cutscene_final_4            The last remaining Green are trying to launch the Ark
cutscene_final_5            Thank goodness for that





help3                       This is the Refinery.  It needs several Darwinians to drive the mining carts.  You will need to escort them safely up here.
help4                       This is a Mine.  It needs Darwinians to operate.  It will generate Polygons out of the ground, which will be refined.
