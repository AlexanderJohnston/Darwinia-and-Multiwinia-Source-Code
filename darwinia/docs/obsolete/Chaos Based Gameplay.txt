
SYSTEMS

- Mana 
    All spells cost mana to cast
    Mana is recharged by time / wizard castles / landmarks

- Concentration
    Remains at a constant value
    'Allocated' by spells that require constant attention
    eg an Illusional creature requires (say) 100 concentration to retain illusion
    eg Undead require concentration to remain animated
    Diminished by nearby enemy armies
    Sudden drop when wizard is attacked
    When it drops too low, a random spell is stopped

- Summoning Chaos Creatures
    Player picks the troop type
    Then drags out a portal - a tear in space
    Size of portal determines Mana cost / concentration cost / rate of unit creation / time to open
    Portal then takes time to open
    Then troops flood out - Each troop costs mana
    If you lose concentration, the portal remains open and newly spawned creatures attack everything nearby
    Portals cost mana to close
   
- Summoning Order Creatures
    Player picks the troop type
    Then drags a creation circle representing number of troops
    Column of light then appears
    Grows in diameter to match size (other players don't see the requested size)
    When complete, some fancy graphical effect
    Then all troops appear where the column was

- Combat
    

- Magic
    Spells are cast as a sequence of runes
    The wizard must perform these runes as gestures
    eg 'Summon' + 'Chaos' + 'Fire' + 'Flight' = Dragon
    Can append additional runes onto spells, eg 'Illusion' or 'Permenant'
    As the wizard performs the runes, effects begin to appear around him and his target
    This makes him visible to other wizards
    It also gives other wizards time to respond

- Permenance    
    Spells can be cast as 'Permenant'
    Each time the spell "goes off" it uses its mana cost
    The permenance requires a Concentration allocation
    eg a Permenant fireball spell   

- Stats
    A wizard can apply modifiers to stats of selected units
    eg Speed = Speed * 1.5
    Costs mana to do so
    Creatures decrease to normal over time

- Fire
    Fire spell
    Some landscape can catch fire eg forest
    Creatures in burning areas catch fire
    Creatures adjacent to burning creatures catch fire
    Fire damages creatures
    Water puts out fire
    Flaming Mongrels!

- Undead
    Created using Raise Dead spell
    Causes serious morale issues to enemy
    Vulnerable to magic
    Can walk under water
    Require concentration to remain animated

- Illusion
    Creatures can be created as illusion
    They look identical but cannot fight or be killed
    Much lower mana cost
    Safe if chaos illusion - they cannot turn on you
    They require a Concentration Allocation
    They can be "disbelieved"
    Require Line of Site?
