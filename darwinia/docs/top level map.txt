TOP LEVEL MAP
=============


- Seperate landscape definition from mission definition
    Move landscape def and static tile data into seperate map files
    Each level file specifies a map file at the start
    Map files have a list of static buildings which will appear on all levels on this map
    Level files also have a list of buildings, which are specific to the level
    All buildings need a new flag which specifies if they are static or dynamic
    Put building flag into editor

- Top level landscape Auto generated from all maps
    Much lower resolution
    Light data for each island?

    Transition effect
    Disguise loading

- Need to be able to view from higher/further
    Less fog
    No clouds

        All red guys dead
        etc
    List of global data changes

            Ownership / Enabled / Disabled
            Can calculate orientation from global data

    Research
        List of research items
            Percentage research complete / Level of research
            eg 250% complete means v2.0 available, v3.0 in production
