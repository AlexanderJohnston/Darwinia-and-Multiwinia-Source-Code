Thoughts on Direct Sound filters

- Distortion seems to operate in the frequency domain, which is too expensive
  for a software implementation (without lots of work optimising)
- Minimal distortion still causes lots of distortion - it is quite important
  that distortion can fade out to nothing gradually.
- ParamEq is too expensive for a software implementation
- I can't see the point in implementing Compressor
- The DirectSound Gargle filter doesn't have a wet/dry mix variable. It should
  have. Also it can't deal with decimal frequencies. Therefore I propose that 
  we use our own Gargle filter.
- DirectSound Echo filter has stereo gubbins. It doesn't need to.
  
General Sound System:

- Squadie laser fire goes missing too easily on the Labs level
- Direct Sound software mode is clicky as fuck on my machine
- I'd like to be able to toggle the scale of the parameter window graph
  between linear and log, to make it easier to adjust variables like
  loop delay for very small values. Should display whether in linear or
  log mode by drawing linearly or logrithmically ruled vertical lines on 
  the graph
- The SoundLibrary2d buffer size is currently 2000 samples for a 44khz buffer. 
  That probably needs to be adjustable.
- Sort out SetChannelVolume for software mixer
- Sort out SetChannel3dMode for software mixer
