
The top level map will be rendered as the inside of a sphere.

- Locations will show up on the inside of the sphere
- At the centre of the sphere is "heaven"
- There is a thick communication line with the outside world, which starts at
    "heaven", and runs all the way through the edge of the world to the outside
- There are lines running down from Heaven to every island
- These lines bring a constant supply of new spirits down to the islands.  The
    spirits land on some kind of connecting port and move away from it


- The outer sphere should be a lattice-like framework that becomes increasingly
    detailed as you zoom in
- The outer sphere is almost entirely opaque, with some form of 
    star field behind
- The sphere comes to an edge around the incoming comms line
- There are various god like objects floating around, eg zepellins
- The player can see spirits falling down to each island

Requirements
============

- The spherical world must be at least partly visible from the island
    This will require a low-res version of the top level map
