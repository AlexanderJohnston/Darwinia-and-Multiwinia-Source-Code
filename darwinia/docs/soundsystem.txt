=================

- New Events:
    Triffid             Burn
    SpiritReceiver      TriggerSpirit
    SpiritProcessor     TriggerSpirit
    ReceiverLink        TriggerSpirit
    Spam                Explode
    Spam                Attack
    Generator           Enable
    Ambience            ExitLocation
    Ambience            EnterGlobalWorld


- All entities now have an ExitTeleport event which will trigger when they
    exit from a teleport.

- Fixed : Officer::SetOrder... events weren't toggling off when the order 
    was cancelled

- SporeGenerator::LayEgg definately works fine for me

- Spam objects can be found on the final level, titled "Temple".

- Tree::Create will now be stopped when Tree::Burn begins.
- Tree::Create will be triggered when Tree::Burn ends.

- To test Generator::Enable, simply go to the Generator level and create an 
    engineer near the central Generator.  He will reprogram the nearby
    control tower.

- Worked on sound code for Sepulveda.
    New events : Appear and Disappear, for when he pops up then goes away.
    TextAppear should now work.
    Make sure you set positiontype to TYPE2D or you won't here anything.


================
3rd January 2005
================

- Modified the DropDownMenu so it will split into two colums or more if there
  are enough entries to make it stretch off the screen.  This mostly affects
  the sample group selector, since there are so many of them.

- Modified the sound priority code, so that a sound with ADSR would have its
  priority affected by its volume AFTER ADSR had been applied.  This helps 
  with samples with 10 second release phases, as their priorities now fall.

- New Events:
    Armour          LoadDarwinian
    Armour          UnloadDarwinian
    Officer         SetOrderNone
    Officer         SetOrderGoto
    Officer         SetOrderFollow
    Officer         SetOrderAbsorb
    AntHill         Damage
    AntHill         Explode                     (best to set to Type3DStationary)
    ResearchItem    AquireResearch              (best to set to Type3DStationary)
    GunTurret       TargetSighted

- SporeGenerator::LayEggs does appear to work fine for me.  Check your settings?
    Alternatively you can use Egg::Create

- Fixed : Engineer:LoseHealth event not triggering
- Fixed : Engineer:Die event not triggering

- Fixed : Accessing Officer in the sound editor caused a crash
- Fixed : Accessing Armour in the sound editor caused a crash

- Fixed : The key 'p' could not be used for names as it always triggered
          a screengrab

- To see a research item, create a brand new profile:
    In the global world, press esc to get the main menu.  Then click profile.
    Type in an unused profile name, then click Create.  You should have one 
    location visible : labs.  Go there.  You will see a blue spinning box - this
    is a research item.
    (In the BoredBetaTester profile you already have all research, so you won't
    see any research items lying around)
    
- Yard Animations are finished

- Set your credit entries to:
    Sound Design and Production by Alistair Lindsay and Michael Maidment.

- Fixed : TrunkPorts.  Use the PowerUp event to trigger a looping sound.
          This event will only be triggered when a trunk port comes on.



=============
14th Oct 2004
=============

- New events:
    Mine        CogTurn             (applies to all buildings on the mine)
    Triffid     LaunchEgg
    TriffidEgg  Bounce
    TriffidEgg  BurstOpen
    LaserFence  Spark
    Incubator   AddSpirit
    Incubator   SpawnEntity
    SolarPanel  TriggerSurge        (applies to all buildings on the Generator)
    Tree        Burn
    TrunkPort   PowerUp             (There is no PowerDown event, as that never happens)


- Linked building sounds to the centre position of a building, rather than 
  the base position

- Fixed : Location ambiences were not being stopped when you exited a location

- Fixed : It was impossible to make a tree burn

- Fixed : RadarDish:EndRotation event was going off a few seconds too late

- Fixed : With the sound stats window open and all sounds being rendered in 3d,
          sounds that faded out would get larger and larger on screen until
          they filled the entire screen

- Fixed : Changing a sounds MinDistance parameter had no effect until the
          sound was restarted.

- Fixed : We were permitting MinDistance values of less than 1.0, but that is
          illegal and was causing a crash within Direct Sound


==============
28th Sept 2004
==============

- New events:
    Engineer    BeginReprogramming
    Engineer    EndReprogramming
    Engineer    ReprogrammingComplete
    Spider      Pounce
    Spider      PounceLand
    Spider      FootFall
    RadarDish   BeginRotation
    RadarDish   EndRotation
    RadarDish   ConnectionEstablished
    RadarDish   ConnectionLost

- Extended range of ADSR to Attack:60 secs, Sustain:300 secs, Release:60 secs

- Fixed : Illegal values were permitted for WavesReverb filter


===============
6th August 2004
===============

= Wrote our own software sound mixer to replace Direct Sound in software mode.
= Wrote replacement filters for Gargle and Echo

- Changed the volume system to work on a new and improved scale
- Modified the Parameter editor to allow you to edit on a logarithmic scale as
  well as a linear scale

- Fixed : Officer Create event was not being triggered


==============
25th June 2004
==============

= Wrote an entirely new priority system, that no longer requires User 
  Priorities.  A sounds priority is now based on its volume, distance to 
  camera, and the number of existing instances already playing.

- When the SoundStats window is visible (F7), blue speaker icons will be 
  drawn over all currently playing sound effects in the world.  The size of the
  icon represents the volume, and the brightness represents the priority.

- Fixed some problems with filters


==============
10th June 2004
==============

= Improved the stability of the whole system but with some speed penalty. The
  result is that sounds with freq > 1 should work better now. Also, there
  should be less lag between events being triggered and the sound being played.

- Fixed the problem that cause echo and reverb filters to shutdown the game

- Added new events for Centipede : Panic, EnemySighted


=============
3rd June 2004
=============

= Made another change to the priority system.  A sound will now have a lower 
  priority if there are already many instances of the sound playing.  Each
  existing instance of a sound decreases all identical sounds priorities by
  10%.  Eg if you have 4 lasers already playing, their priorities will all be
  reduced by 40%.  This stops heavily used sounds from dominating the sound
  stage - eg Lasers.

- New "Purge Sounds" window, designed for clearing out unused sounds. 
  You can access it by clicking on the Purge Sounds button in the
  main Sounds Editor window, bottom left corner.

- Scrollbar added to SampleGroup Editor


=============
18th May 2004
=============

- New events for Darwinians

- Airstrike bombs now have their own sound events, seperate from standard 
  grenades.  The object type is Other::AirstrikeBomb.


============
9th May 2004
============

- Fixed : Engineer's Create event was not triggering properly.
          This bug also affected the Darwinians.

- Fixed : Rocket Explode event was not killing its Create event properly

- Fixed : Volume setting wasn't working, all sounds we're playing with the
          same volume.

- Added ability to rename SampleGroups.  The rename button can be found in the
  sample group editor.

= Made a change to the way sound priorities are handled.  Previously a maximum
  of 10 new sounds would be started every second, with all failed requests
  being discarded.  This caused important sounds to be discarded if they went
  off at the same time - eg Grenade Flash and Grenade Bang both occur 
  simultaniously, but one would be discarded.  Now all sounds will have a 
  number of restart attempts based on their priority.  The sound system will
  attempt to restart them this many times. This does mean that high priority
  sounds could (in theory) start up to 300ms late, although this is unlikely.
  Looping sounds will never be discarded until they are stopped, as before.
  Initial testing shows an obvious improvement when there are lots of big
  sounds on screen at once - eg an Air Strike.
  Priority 0 - 99    :    1 attempt only (as before)
  Priority 100 - 199 :    2 restart attempts
  Priority 200 - 255 :    3 restart attempts
  Looping sounds     :    unlimited restart attempts


===============
29th April 2004
===============

- Added in lots of hooks for Other objects - weapons, rockets, grenades etc

- Made it possible to attach sounds to Other objects.  Eg you can now attach
  a sound to a Grenade in flight.


===============
13th April 2004
===============

= Ability to select Parameter Update Type.  You now have the option for any 
  parameter (eg Frequency) to update either constantly (10 times per second)
  or only once per restart.  Selecting the latter would cause frequency to
  change only when the sound was restarted - ie after a loop has occured.
  The default is to update constantly.
  This option can be set in the Parameter Editor Window.  

= Polyphonic and Monophonic sound types now available as options.
  Making a sound Polyphonic will behave just as before : one seperate sound
  instance for every event, eg a group of 5 squadies with a create event 
  would spawn 5 seperate sounds.
  Making a sound Monophonic will mean there will be a maximum of one particular
  sound instance at any time.  Eg 5 squadies with a create event would all be
  sharing one single sound instance.
  The monophonic sound option is currently only available for Entities, and you
  can chose how the sound attaches to them.  Select MonophonicRandom and the
  single instance will move randomly between all the sources.  Select
  MonophonicNearest and the single instance will be attached to the nearest
  sound source to the camera. 

- Better error trapping.  Darwinia will now pop up a message box with some 
  additional information about an error, such as error code, description etc.

- Sound Stats window (F8) now displays the sound hardware devices that are
  installed on the system

- When the Sound Stats Window is visible, all currently playing sounds will be
  rendered within the game world as white stars.  The size of the star 
  represents the sound's volume, and the brightness of the star represents its
  priority.

- Darwinia will now check you have directX9 before running

- Sound Selector dialog will now allow you to select multiple files at a time,
  by holding down the ctrl key and clicking on each file

- Fixed a crashing bug that occurred if you clicked in certain places in the
  sound editor window when no object was selected
  
- Reduced distortion in the RLP filter. Also made it 20% faster.

- Reduced Doppler effect to 20% of the default value (it was far too prominent)

- Darwinia will now report an error if sound samples aren't in the correct
  format. The samples must be mono and must not have spaces in the filename.
  
- Sounds engaged in a Loop Delay (ie waiting to restart) will have their 
  priorities set to zero since they are making no sound


===============
22nd March 2004
===============

= ADSR functionality.  All SoundInstances now have three new 
  parameters: Attack, Sustain and Release.  These only apply to looping sounds.
  Attack specifies time (in seconds) for the volume to fade up at start.
  Release specifies time (in seconds) for the volume to fade down at end.
  If Sustain is set to zero, sounds will loop forever until released by an event
  (eg the entity which the sound is attached to died).  Once released they will
  continue to loop while fading out over the time specified by Release.
  If Sustain is set to greater than zero, the sound will fade up, loop for this
  length of time, then fade out.
  
= Loop Delay parameter.  This specifies the time (in seconds) to wait between
  a looping sound coming to its end, and restarting.  Eg set this to 2 on a
  looping sound - the sound will play, then silence for 2 seconds, then play,
  then silence for 2 seconds etc.
  NOTE : Attack is only applied when the event is triggered, and Release is
  only applied when the event is released.  If sustain is specified then this
  event will last for that length of time.  This means the adsr fading is not
  attached to the sample looping itself..but to the event that is playing the
  sample.

= New Loop Mode : LoopADSR.  This mode applies ADSR to the looping sound sample
  rather than the parent event.  Used in conjunction with Loop Delay and Sound 
  Groups it can be used to smoothly cross fade sounds.
  A sound in this mode will fade up in (Attack)secs, then play for (Sustain)secs.
  It will then begin its Release phase and fade out over (Release)secs.  After
  (Delay)secs have passed since the beginning of the Release phase, the same 
  sound will be triggered again and will begin in Attack phase.
  Note the Delay period can be less than the Release period, which would mean
  2 sounds would be playing at once and overlapping.  This is the intention.
  Eg creating a sound with Attack=3, Sustain=10, Release=3, LoopDelay=0 will
  cause the sound to fade up in 3 secs, play for 10, then cross fade over 3 
  seconds into another instance of the same sound.

= SampleGroup support added.  This allows you to select multiple sound sources
  for a given event, rather than just one.  Do this by setting the SourceType
  field to SampleGroupRandom, then add your chosen samples to a new sample
  group.  When looping the chosen sample will be randomly selected from the 
  list every loop.  If you are using LoopADSR mode the chosen sample will be
  changed only when the current instance fades out and the new one fades in,
  ie when the Sustain period has passed.
  This is a bit complex, call Chris if it doesn't make any sense to you.

= Rewrote entire sound library to get rid of FMOD and use directSound.
  We can now play sounds pretty much latency free
  We can do FX on those sounds latency free
  There is no longer a minimum sample size for FX

= New sound system profiler has been created. Press F9 to bring it up.

- Resonant low pass filter now works

- New filter : BitCrusher, which dynamically resamples a sound to a 
  lower bit rate

- Can now click the "Select Object" button in the sound editor window and
  the click on an object to bring up it's sound event handlers

- Volume has now changed - there are now two parameters
  MinDistance - the distance at which the sound begins to attenuate
  Volume      - Logarithmic value from 0.0f to 10.0f 
				representing maximum sound volume

- Looping sounds will now continue playing from where they left off after being
  switched out, rather than restarting from the beginning

- Lowered font size in File Dialog
  
- Double click now works in file dialogs

- Slightly improved smoothing factor range

- Implemented a save on exit dialog



==================
REQUESTED FEATURES
==================

- souls - in 'reciever' level, couldnt test the sounds for the soul descending, 
  then shooting down the wires.
 
- solar panels - got sounds in for the initial burst of electricity, but it 
  needs something as they zing down the wires.

- trunkports - some levels have them enabled at the start, so using the 
  reprogram link means that enabled trunkports are silent, using the create 
  means ports awaiting enabling are already making a noise.

- Radar dish align STOP event is a couple of second too late
- Echo decrease frequency every loop effect
  
- is there any way to display which samples are being played- at the moment the 
  stats screen only tellme which samplegroup is being played, not the individual 
  samples? 

- Is it possible to configure your random number generator so that it will 
  never pick the same number twice in X generations where X is the total 
  number of samples in a sample group? 
  
- Option to apply LoopDelay before sample is played for the first time.  
  Currently all sounds are played immediately, then loop delay begins.
   
- Unable to select subdirectories for sound effects in file selector dialog

- Fix the click through that causes the squadies to move around when editing
  sounds

- "Quorking" occurs because lots of entities start the same sound at the same time
  when their create event goes off, causing nasty flange effects



==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========

- Anyone who goes through a Teleport will have their permenantly looping sounds
  stopped - eg the Squadie chatter.  This is because their unit ID changes, 
  so they are no longer accessable by their old entityID.  The sound system
  assumes they have died and kills their looping sounds.

- Trying to run multiple different FX on one sample causes a crash

- Will crash if you pick an event already running (eg Building Create), then 
  change to selecting a sample group.  Tries to load sample filename as a group

- Flanger: Feedback values approaching +99% cause sound to cut in and out.
  Value of -99%is ok though.

- Parameter Editor Window.  Select parameter type of Ranged Random, with update
  type set to OncePerRestart.  The green line representing the chosen random
  frequency does not match the sound coming out of the speakers, because it is
  a seperate sound parameter which generates a different random answer.
